Each of you Will work with a spccial "binary bomb". A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequcncc of
Phases. Each Phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. Ä°f you type the correct string, then the Phase is
defused and thc bomb procceds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing " BOOM ! ! ! !' and then
terminating. The bomb is defused when every Phase has been defused.
